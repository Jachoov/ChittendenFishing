        <h2>Species of Trout</h2>
        <p>Trout are some of the most prized fish for anglers in Vermont. The significance of trout to Vermont and its counties is evident in the state fish, the brook trout. 
        While the brook trout is known for its dazzling colors and sustainable native population, there are certainly many other species of trout to target. Rainbow trout are 
        commonly stocked across the state and thrive in ponds, lakes, and rivers. Brown trout are a hard fighting species of trout that also enjoy lakes, ponds, and rivers. 
        Lake trout are known for typically growing the largest out of the trout species, and are almost exclusively caught in large lakes.</p>

        <h2>How to catch trout</h2>
        <p>There are many different ways to catch trout. For lakes and ponds it is easiest to use a worm with a small sinker. In rivers and streams fly fishing is often used 
        with a special kind of line and lures. If you have access to a boat it is helpful to troll a shiny metal lure in order to attract trout. Due to the variety of 
        waterbodies in Chittenden County, it is best to come prepared with several tactics to target trout on any given day.</p>
